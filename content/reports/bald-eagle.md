Gia and I were on a walk with Warren & Ruth. We walked around [some lakes near Warren's house](https://goo.gl/maps/dTQNCjK6Va8Rqy9HA) where we saw a ton of other birds besides just Bald Eagles, including Hooded Mergansers, Cormoranths, Robins, Red Bellied Woodpeckers, Northern Cardinals, and several Great Blue Herons. We saw a pair of Bald Eagles flying over the lake and eventually they landed high up in a tree. They were soon joined by a juvenile Bald Eagle, presumably their offspring.
