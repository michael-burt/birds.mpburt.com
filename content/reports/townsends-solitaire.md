I was camping with my dad down in Ca√±on City, Colorado. We camped at Oil Well flats and I saw a Townsend's Solitaire near our camp, I got a very clear look at it through my dad's scope. We ended up Driving Shelf Road on the way home and checking out [Vindicator Valley Trail](https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7024309/vindicator-valley-trail) on our bikes.
