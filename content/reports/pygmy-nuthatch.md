Gia and I were on a walk on the [Homestead Trail](https://bouldercolorado.gov/trail/homestead) in Boulder. We saw a small flock of Pygmy Nuthatches hanging out in some pine trees near the trail. We saw them around 3:30PM on a nice sunny day, around 50 &deg;F.

They seem to be really social birds, and they make the most ridiculous chirps.

We also heard some Mountain Chickadees with them.
