# Background

Prometheus and OpenTelemetry are two well known and widely adopted observability technologies. Prometheus is a pull-based metrics system which scrapes metrics and stores them locally in a TSDB. OpenTelemetry is a interoperable standard for receiving, processing, and exporting telemetry data, including traces and logs (unlike Prometheus). OpenTelemetry was born out of the merger between OpenCensus & OpenTracing projects in 2019. The Prometheus project was started in 2012 at SoundCloud, predating oTel by many years. 

Over the lifetime of the project, Prometheus has come to be the de facto standard for cloud-native monitoring. It works well in high-cardinality, Kubernetes-based environments. Surrounding Prometheus is a vibrant ecosystem of projects, including Thanos (and Cortex) both of which aim to scale out Prometheus in terms of ingestion, storage, querying, and rule evaluation.

These two technologies frequently coexist in an observability platform, especially in complex environments with multiple teams with differing needs when it comes to observability.
