Hi, my name is Michael and this is my site. This blog is an attempt to share my thoughts about things I work on professionally or am otherwise interested in. 

I am a Senior Software Engineer at Splunk where I work on general observability projects in the Platform Observability org. Before Splunk I worked in a variety of startups in the energy space, and even spent some time at NREL.

My family and I are lucky to call Boulder, Colorado our home :house:
